# Neptune_Prototype
Neptune is a software made to help swimmers with their progress through practices and meets.
It's capable of recording the distance in a single practice and the total distance of all the practices (yards and meters).
Another feature is the ability to rank your fastest times in any event of your choice.
This prototype was made with the purpose of being the beginning of a software focused on swimmers and their evolution.

With Neptune, you can reach even higher waters.
